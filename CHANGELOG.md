# V1.0.5 Update 1
Before I get into the changes/fixes, I want to say I am very sorry for the wait on this patch.

- Added integration with Skinwalker mod. (Clips recorded by the Skinwalker mod have a chance of playing randomly).
- Added functionality to pills.
- Added more settings to the config file.

- Fixed Flashlights not actually lowering sanity loss.
- Fixed panic attack debuffs being permanent.
- Fixed panic visual/audio effects happening instantly instead of over time.

## Planned Features for next update:
- Insanity gain/loss scaling for amount of players in lobby.
- More panic attack debuffs.
- Insanity gain or loss from certain events.

As always, please let me know of any suggestions you have for the mod and do not be afraid to report any bugs on the github.

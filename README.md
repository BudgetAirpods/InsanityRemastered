# Insanity Remastered

# An alpha version of the next update along with its changelog can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/BudgetAirpods/InsanityRemastered/tree/(ALPHA/EXPERIMENTAL)-Update-V1.1)

## This mod is best experienced with smaller lobbies. (4-6) players.
A mod for Lethal Company that adds more features to the insanity mechanic.

This is a client-sided mod as it would be odd if other players could see your hallucinations.

Installation:
Drag InsanityRemastered.dll and the files with the prefix "SoundResources" into the plugins folder of bepinex.

**This mod is far from being done.**

### View the trello board to see what I'm working on currently: https://trello.com/b/trtanZtI/insanity-remastered

## Additions / Changes:

**Increased insanity cap to 200 instead of 50.**

## Sanity Loss and Gain methods:

### Losing Sanity:
   - Being alone inside the facility will cause you to lose sanity.
   - During the Light Shutoff hallucination, you will lose a bit more sanity than normal.
   - Certain hallucinations can cause more sanity loss.
   - (MIGHT ADD) When going deeper into the facility, you will lose more sanity. (The further you are from an exit, the more sanity you will lose).

### Gaining Sanity:
   - Flashlights will reduce the sanity drain amount when turned on, making them really useful in this mod.
   - Being around players will allow your sanity to regen when inside the facility. Better buddy up!
   - Consuming pills will reset your insanity level entirely.
   - (PLANNED) Being near any light source will also reduce sanity loss.
     
**There are now three levels of insanity. High, Medium, and Low.**
   - As your insanity level progresses, you will experience more intense hallucinations.
### Sound Hallucinations:
In addition to the current sounds that play when inside the facility, this mod adds several new sounds to throw you off.

There's also a chance certain vanilla sound effects will play to make the sounds more believable.

### Light Shutoff:

While inside the facility, the lights have a chance to go out for you and you only.

They will power back on their own eventually, but you can step outside and re-enter the facility to force them on.
### Player Hallucinations:

While exploring the facilities, you have a chance of running into a hallucination of a player.

This can manifest in them wandering around the facility aimlessly, staring at you, or even them chasing after you.

If you are touched by the hallucination when it's chasing you, you can recieve a few effects.

They are easy to avoid though; Simply closing a door on them or leaving the facility will prevent them from getting you. 

### Fake Items:

While inside the facility, you can stumble upon a piece of scrap that feels off, and for good reason too. 

Scanning it will reveal that is has no value, and picking it up can have several effects on you.

It will despawn if it is not picked up within a few seconds of spawning.

#### Panic Attacks:

At the highest level of insanity, you will slowly experience a panic attack.

During one, almost all hallucinations become lethal and you experience one of the following symptoms:
- Slowness.
- Whispering from unknown sources.
- Reduced Stamina.
- Reduced Vision.
- Death.

Panic attacks can be helped by stepping outside the facility for a while.

## Planned Features:

As I have stated, this is only the first version of this mod.

I already have plans for or I am already working on new things such as:

- Hallucinations of any enemy. (Bracken, Thumper, etc.)
- Fake Rooms
- Replacing teammates models with enemy models.
- ~~Integration with mods such as Skinwalker to play recordings as hallucination sounds~~.
- The observer.

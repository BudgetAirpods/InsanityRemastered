# Insanity Remastered
A mod for Lethal Company that adds more features to the insanity mechanic.
## Reworks 
Insanity Remastered changes how the insanity mechanic works in a couple of ways. 

- **The max insanity value is change to accomodate for additions from this mod.**
    - This makes you more vulnerable to the Ghost Girl.
    - To combat this, you can recover sanity through various methods.
      
- **There are now three levels of insanity. High, Medium, and Low.**
   - As your insanity level progresses, you will experience more intense hallucinations.
   - When you reach a high enough insanity level, you will experience a "Panic Attack".
   - Leaving the building for a few minutes will relieve the symptoms the panic attack.

# Insanity Remastered
A mod for Lethal Company that adds more features to the insanity mechanic.


**This mod is far from being done. This is only the first version. I have much more planned for this mod.**
## Reworks 
Insanity Remastered changes how the insanity mechanic works in a couple of ways. 

- **The max insanity value is increased to accomodate for additions from this mod.**
    - This makes you more vulnerable to the Ghost Girl.
    - To combat this, you can recover sanity through various methods.
      
- **There are now three levels of insanity. High, Medium, and Low.**
   - As your insanity level progresses, you will experience more intense hallucinations.
   - When you reach a high enough insanity level, you will experience a "Panic Attack".
   - Leaving the building for a few minutes will relieve the symptoms the panic attack.
   - **(OPTIONAL)** Staying inside the building while experiencing a panic attack will have a chance to kill you.
## Additions:

### Sound Hallucinations:
In addition to the current sounds that play when inside the facility, this mod adds several new sounds to unnerve you.
There's also a chance certain vanilla sound effects will play to make the hallucinations more believable.

### Player Hallucinations:

When you reach a high insanity level, you can experience hallucinations of other players.

This can manifest in them walking around the facility aimlessly, staring at you, or even them chasing you.

If you are touched by the hallucination if it's chasing you, you will recieve a lot of negative effects.

They are easy to avoid though; Simply closing the door or leaving the facility will prevent them from getting you. 

### Fake Items:

When inside the facility, you can stumble upon a piece of scrap that feels off, and for good reason too. 

Scanning it will reveal that is has no value, and picking it up can have several effects on you.

It will despawn if it is not picked up after a few seconds.

#### Panic Attacks:

At the highest level of insanity, you will slowly experience what I like to call a panick attack.

During one, almost all hallucinations become lethal andw
